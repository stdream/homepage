      "abstract": "Abstract The aim of this critical review paper is threefold: (a) to provide an insight on the impact of ontology engineering methodologies (OEMs) to the evolution of living and reused ontologies, (b) to update the ontology engineering (OE) community on the status and trends in OEMs and of their use in practice and (c) to propose a set of recommendations for working ontologists to consider during the life cycle of living, evolved and reused ontologies. The work outlined in this critical review paper has been motivated by the need to address critical issues on keeping ontologies alive and evolving while these are shared in wide communities. It is argued that the engineering of ontologies must follow a well-defined methodology, addressing practical aspects that would allow (sometimes wide) communities of experts and ontologists to reach consensus on developments and keep the evolution of ontologies ‘in track’. In doing so, specific collaborative and iterative tool-supported tasks and phases within a complete and evaluated ontology life cycle are necessary. This way the engineered ontologies can be considered ‘shared, commonly agreed and continuously evolved “live” conceptualizations’ of domains of discourse. Today, in the era of Linked Data and Knowledge Graphs, it is more necessary than ever not to neglect to consider the recommendations that OEMs explicitly and implicitly introduce and their implications to the evolution of living ontologies. This paper reports on the status of OEMs, identifies trends and provides recommendations based on the findings of an analysis that concerns the impact of OEMs to the status of well-known, widely used and representative ontologies.",

      "abstract": "Ontologies provide a powerful method for representing, reusing, and sharing domain knowledge. They are extensively used in a wide range of disciplines, including artificial intelligence, knowledge engineering, biomedical informatics, and many more. For several reasons, developing domain ontologies is a challenging task. One of these reasons is that it is a complicated and time-consuming process. Multiple ontology development methodologies have already been proposed. However, there is room for improvement in terms of covering more activities during development (such as enrichment) and enhancing others (such as conceptualization). In this research, an enhanced ontology development methodology (ON-ODM) is proposed. Ontology-driven conceptual modeling (ODCM) and natural language processing (NLP) serve as the foundation of the proposed methodology. ODCM is defined as the utilization of ontological ideas from various areas to build engineering artifacts that improve conceptual modeling. NLP refers to the scientific discipline that employs computer techniques to analyze human language. The proposed ON-ODM is applied to build a tourism ontology that will be beneficial for a variety of applications, including e-tourism. The produced ontology is evaluated based on competency questions (CQs) and quality metrics. It is verified that the ontology answers SPARQL queries covering all CQ groups specified by domain experts. Quality metrics are used to compare the produced ontology with four existing tourism ontologies. For instance, according to the metrics related to conciseness, the produced ontology received a first place ranking when compared to the others, whereas it received a second place ranking regarding understandability. These results show that utilizing ODCM and NLP could facilitate and improve the development process, respectively.",

      "abstract": "Ontology engineering (OE) plays a critical role in modeling and managing structured knowledge across various domains. This study examines the performance of fine-tuned large language models (LLMs), specifically GPT-4 and Mistral 7B, in efficiently automating OE tasks. Foundational OE textbooks are used as the basis for dataset creation and for feeding the LLMs. The methodology involved segmenting texts into manageable chapters, generating question–answer pairs, and translating visual elements into description logic to curate fine-tuned datasets in JSONL format. This research aims to enhance the models’ abilities to generate domain-specific ontologies, with hypotheses asserting that fine-tuned LLMs would outperform base models, and that domain-specific datasets would significantly improve their performance. Comparative experiments revealed that GPT-4 demonstrated superior accuracy and adherence to ontology syntax, albeit with higher computational costs. Conversely, Mistral 7B excelled in speed and cost efficiency but struggled with domain-specific tasks, often generating outputs that lacked syntactical precision and relevance. The presented results highlight the necessity of integrating domain-specific datasets to improve contextual understanding and practical utility in specialized applications, such as Search and Rescue (SAR) missions in wildfire incidents. Both models, despite their limitations, exhibited potential in understanding OE principles. However, their performance underscored the importance of aligning training data with domain-specific knowledge to emulate human expertise effectively. This study, based on and extending our previous work on the topic, concludes that fine-tuned LLMs with targeted datasets enhance their utility in OE, offering insights into improving future models for domain-specific applications. The findings advocate further exploration of hybrid solutions to balance accuracy and efficiency.",

These limitations have been identified in several recent research works. Ontology-based Engineering (OBE) systems can stand overly complex collaborative design processes involving multidisciplinary stakeholders and various digital tools, integrating different levels of decision. Models for Manufacturing (MfM) is an OBE methodology aiming to enable industrial design and decision-making in manufacturing by preserving the company knowledge in ontology models, usable as knowledge base to generate and integrate the aircraft and manufacturing systems design. This paper presents an MfM application for RMS design in aerospace, introducing innovative design concepts that allow implementing RMS in a collaborative engineering process of an aerospace product. An implementation is shown designing the RMS of a model aircraft family to illustrate the concepts introduced and considerations are given to transfer this knowledge base into an OBE system to support complex real-life applications.",

This article explores the multifaceted realms of human and machine collaborative ontology engineering (OE). The goal of the presented work is to explore the potential of Large Language Models (LLMs) to speed up and automate the processes of collaborative OE, experimenting with different levels of LLM involvement. The proposed approach is based on a human-centered approach, that is, the HCOME approach to collaborative OE, and follows a process of exploring the declining involvement of humans and the parallel increase of LLM involvement, concluding at a level of automation where the OE is exclusively performed by LLMs. This experimentation is organized based on a series of human/LLM collaboration levels (a spectrum of OE), each one aligned to a specific OE methodology, that is, Level-0 HCOME (Human), Level-1 X-HCOME (Human and LLMs), Level-2 SimX-HCOME (LLMs and Human), and Level-3 Sim-HCOME (LLMs). The evaluation of these methodologies (one per level) is performed by measuring the similarity of the generated ontologies against “reference” ontologies (precision, recall, and F1-score of reference-to-LLM-generated ontological mappings). The results presented in this paper demonstrate that while LLMs significantly expedite the OE process, the accuracy and completeness of the resulting ontologies are notably enhanced by maintaining a high level of human involvement. This study is expected to contribute to a deeper understanding of evolving dynamics in LLM-based/enhanced OE, paving the way for future advancements toward more effective collaborative OE frameworks.",

      "abstract": "OTTR is a language for representing ontology modeling patterns, which enables to build ontologies or knowledge bases by instantiating templates. Thereby, particularities of the ontological representation language are hidden from the domain experts, and it enables ontology engineers to, to some extent, separate the processes of deciding about what information to model from deciding about how to model the information, e.g., which design patterns to use. Certain decisions can thus be postponed for the benefit of focusing on one of these processes. To date, only few works on ontology engineering where ontology templates are applied are described in the literature. In this paper, we outline our methodology and report findings from our ontology engineering activities in the domain of Material Science. In these activities, OTTR templates play a key role. Our ontology engineering process is bottom-up, as we begin modeling activities from existing data that is then, via templates, fed into a knowledge graph, and it is top-down, as we first focus on which data to model and postpone the decision of how to model the data. We find, among other things, that OTTR templates are especially useful as a means of communication with domain experts. Furthermore, we find that because OTTR templates encapsulate modeling decisions, the engineering process becomes flexible, meaning that design decisions can be changed at little cost.",

We then extract the knowledge about controlled vocabularies by querying that knowledge graph, i.e., the engineered ontology.

Although various techniques exist for the creation of ontology, most of the methods involve the number of complex phases, scenario-dependent ontology development, and poor validation of ontology. This research work presents a lightweight approach to build domain ontology using Entity Relationship (ER) model. Firstly, a detailed analysis of intended domain is performed to develop the ER model. In the next phase, ER to ontology (EROnt) conversion rules are outlined, and finally the system prototype is developed to construct the ontology. The proposed approach investigates the domain of information technology curriculum for the successful interpretation of concepts, attributes, relationships of concepts and constraints among the concepts of the ontology. The experts’ evaluation of accurate identification of ontology vocabulary shows that the method performed well on curriculum data with 95.75% average precision and 90.75% average recall.",

      "abstract": "Estimating effort is an essential prerequisite for the wide-scale dispersal of ontologies. Not much attention has yet been paid to this essential aspect of ontology building. To date, ONTOCOM is the most prominent model for ontology cost estimation. Many factors influencing the building cost of an ontology are depicted by linguistic terms like Very High, High, . . . and so on; making them vague and indistinct. This fuzziness is quite uncertain and must be taken into consideration. The available effort estimation models do not consider the uncertainty of fuzziness. In this work, we propose an effort estimation methodology for ontology engineering using Fuzzy Logic i.e. F-ONTOCOM (Fuzzy-ONTOCOM) to overcome of uncertainty and imprecision. We have defined the corresponding Fuzzy sets for each effort multiplier and its associated linguistic value, and represented the same by triangular membership functions. F-ONTOCOM is applied to a dataset of 148 ontology projects and evaluated over various evaluation criteria. FONTOCOM outperforms the existing effort-estimation models; it has been concluded that F-ONTOCOM improves the cost estimation accuracy and estimated cost is very close to actual cost.",
