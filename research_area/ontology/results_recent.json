      "abstract": "We tackle the task of enriching ontologies by automatically translating natural language (NL) into Description Logic (DL). Since Large Language Models (LLMs) are the best tools for translations, we fine-tuned a GPT-3 model to convert NL into OWL Functional Syntax. For fine-tuning, we designed pairs of sentences in NL and the corresponding translations. This training pairs cover various aspects from ontology engineering: instances, class subsumption, domain and range of relations, object properties relationships, disjoint classes, complements, or cardinality restrictions. The resulted axioms are used to enrich an ontology, in a human supervised manner. The developed tool is publicly provided as a Protégé plugin.",

      "abstract": "Integrating deep learning techniques, particularly language models (LMs), with knowledge representation techniques like ontologies has raised widespread attention, urging the need of a platform that supports both paradigms. Although packages such as OWL API and Jena offer robust support for basic ontology processing features, they lack the capability to transform various types of information within ontologies into formats suitable for downstream deep learning-based applications. Moreover, widely-used ontology APIs are primarily Java-based while deep learning frameworks like PyTorch and Tensorflow are mainly for Python programming. To address the needs, we present DeepOnto, a Python package designed for ontology engineering with deep learning. The package encompasses a core ontology processing module founded on the widely-recognised and reliable OWL API, encapsulating its fundamental features in a more “Pythonic” manner and extending its capabilities to incorporate other essential components including reasoning, verbalisation, normalisation, taxonomy, projection, and more. Building on this module, DeepOnto offers a suite of tools, resources, and algorithms that support various ontology engineering tasks, such as ontology alignment and completion, by harnessing deep learning methods, primarily pre-trained LMs. In this paper, we also demonstrate the practical utility of DeepOnto through two use-cases: the Digital Health Coaching in Samsung Research UK and the Bio-ML track of the Ontology Alignment Evaluation Initiative (OAEI).",

      "abstract": "Ontology engineering (OE) in large projects poses a number of challenges arising from the heterogeneous backgrounds of the various stakeholders, domain experts, and their complex interactions with ontology designers. This multi-party interaction often creates systematic ambiguities and biases from the elicitation of ontology requirements, which directly affect the design, evaluation and may jeopardise the target reuse. Meanwhile, current OE methodologies strongly rely on manual activities (e.g., interviews, discussion pages). After collecting evidence on the most crucial OE activities, we introduce \\textbf{OntoChat}, a framework for conversational ontology engineering that supports requirement elicitation, analysis, and testing. By interacting with a conversational agent, users can steer the creation of user stories and the extraction of competency questions, while receiving computational support to analyse the overall requirements and test early versions of the resulting ontologies. We evaluate OntoChat by replicating the engineering of the Music Meta Ontology, and collecting preliminary metrics on the effectiveness of each component from users.

      "abstract": "Ontology engineering (OE) plays a critical role in modeling and managing structured knowledge across various domains. This study examines the performance of fine-tuned large language models (LLMs), specifically GPT-4 and Mistral 7B, in efficiently automating OE tasks. Foundational OE textbooks are used as the basis for dataset creation and for feeding the LLMs. The methodology involved segmenting texts into manageable chapters, generating question–answer pairs, and translating visual elements into description logic to curate fine-tuned datasets in JSONL format. This research aims to enhance the models’ abilities to generate domain-specific ontologies, with hypotheses asserting that fine-tuned LLMs would outperform base models, and that domain-specific datasets would significantly improve their performance. Comparative experiments revealed that GPT-4 demonstrated superior accuracy and adherence to ontology syntax, albeit with higher computational costs. Conversely, Mistral 7B excelled in speed and cost efficiency but struggled with domain-specific tasks, often generating outputs that lacked syntactical precision and relevance. The presented results highlight the necessity of integrating domain-specific datasets to improve contextual understanding and practical utility in specialized applications, such as Search and Rescue (SAR) missions in wildfire incidents. Both models, despite their limitations, exhibited potential in understanding OE principles. However, their performance underscored the importance of aligning training data with domain-specific knowledge to emulate human expertise effectively. This study, based on and extending our previous work on the topic, concludes that fine-tuned LLMs with targeted datasets enhance their utility in OE, offering insights into improving future models for domain-specific applications. The findings advocate further exploration of hybrid solutions to balance accuracy and efficiency.",

      "abstract": "Competency question (CQ) formulation is central to several ontology development and evaluation methodologies. Traditionally, the task of crafting these competency questions heavily relies on the effort of domain experts and knowledge engineers which is often time-consuming and labor-intensive. With the emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs), there arises the possibility to automate and enhance this process. Unlike other similar works which use existing ontologies or knowledge graphs as input to LLMs, we present a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) approach that uses LLMs for the automatic generation of CQs given a set of scientific papers considered to be a domain knowledge base. We investigate its performance and specifically, we study the impact of different number of papers to the RAG and different temperature setting of the LLM. We conduct experiments using GPT-4 on two domain ontology engineering tasks and compare results against ground-truth CQs constructed by domain experts. Empirical assessments on the results, utilizing evaluation metrics (precision and consistency), reveal that compared to zero-shot prompting, adding relevant domain knowledge to the RAG improves the performance of LLMs on generating CQs for concrete ontology engineering tasks.",

      "abstract": "In the continuously evolving landscape of knowledge engineering, the symbiosis and teaming of humans and machines emerge as a pivotal new domain. This article explores the multifaceted realms of human and machine collaborative ontology engineering (OE). The goal of the presented work is to explore the potential of Large Language Models (LLMs) to speed up and automate the processes of collaborative OE, experimenting with different levels of LLM involvement. The proposed approach is based on a human-centered approach, that is, the HCOME approach to collaborative OE, and follows a process of exploring the declining involvement of humans and the parallel increase of LLM involvement, concluding at a level of automation where the OE is exclusively performed by LLMs. This experimentation is organized based on a series of human/LLM collaboration levels (a spectrum of OE), each one aligned to a specific OE methodology, that is, Level-0 HCOME (Human), Level-1 X-HCOME (Human and LLMs), Level-2 SimX-HCOME (LLMs and Human), and Level-3 Sim-HCOME (LLMs). The evaluation of these methodologies (one per level) is performed by measuring the similarity of the generated ontologies against “reference” ontologies (precision, recall, and F1-score of reference-to-LLM-generated ontological mappings). The results presented in this paper demonstrate that while LLMs significantly expedite the OE process, the accuracy and completeness of the resulting ontologies are notably enhanced by maintaining a high level of human involvement. This study is expected to contribute to a deeper understanding of evolving dynamics in LLM-based/enhanced OE, paving the way for future advancements toward more effective collaborative OE frameworks.",

      "abstract": "Currently, ontologies are recognized as the most effective means of formalizing and systematizing knowledge and data in scientific subject area (SSA). Practice has shown that using ontology design patterns is effective in developing the ontology of scientific subject areas. This is due to the fact that scientific subject areas ontology, as a rule, contains a large number of typical fragments that are well described by patterns of ontology design. In the paper, we present an approach to ontology engineering of automatic text processing methods based on ontology design patterns. In order to get an ontology that would describe automatic text processing sufficiently fully, it is required to process a large number of scientific publications and information resources containing information from modeling area. It is possible to facilitate and speed up the process of updating ontology with information from such sources by using lexical and syntactic patterns of ontology design. Our ontology of automatic text processing will become the conceptual basis of an intelligent information resource on modern methods of automatic text processing, which will provide systematization of all information on these methods, its integration into a single information space, convenient navigation through it, as well as meaningful access to it.",

It involves being conscious of relevant information, understanding its meaning, and using that understanding to make well-informed decisions. Awareness systems often need to integrate new knowledge and adapt to changing environments. Ontology reasoning facilitates knowledge integration and evolution, allowing for seamless updates and expansions of the ontology. With the consideration of above, we are providing a quick review on semantic information retrieval and ontology engineering to understand the emerging challenges and future research. In the review we have found that the ontology reasoning addresses the limitations of traditional systems by providing a formal, flexible, and scalable framework for knowledge representation, reasoning, and inference.",

      "abstract": "OTTR is a language for representing ontology modeling patterns, which enables to build ontologies or knowledge bases by instantiating templates. Thereby, particularities of the ontological representation language are hidden from the domain experts, and it enables ontology engineers to, to some extent, separate the processes of deciding about what information to model from deciding about how to model the information, e.g., which design patterns to use. Certain decisions can thus be postponed for the benefit of focusing on one of these processes. To date, only few works on ontology engineering where ontology templates are applied are described in the literature. In this paper, we outline our methodology and report findings from our ontology engineering activities in the domain of Material Science. In these activities, OTTR templates play a key role. Our ontology engineering process is bottom-up, as we begin modeling activities from existing data that is then, via templates, fed into a knowledge graph, and it is top-down, as we first focus on which data to model and postpone the decision of how to model the data. We find, among other things, that OTTR templates are especially useful as a means of communication with domain experts. Furthermore, we find that because OTTR templates encapsulate modeling decisions, the engineering process becomes flexible, meaning that design decisions can be changed at little cost.",

We find that such rewritings can significantly reduce the size of ontologies by capturing repeated expressions with macros. This approach not only offers valuable assistance in enhancing ontology quality and comprehension but can also be seen as a general methodology for evaluating features of rewriting systems (including syntactic macros, templates, or other forms of rewriting rules), which can be analyzed in terms of their influence on computational problems.",

While conventional methods—such as binary, multiclass, and multi-label classification—are effective for simpler problems, they may not adequately address the complexities of some real-world scenarios. This article introduces the Multiplex Classification Framework, a novel approach developed to tackle these and similar challenges through the integration of problem transformation, ontology engineering, and model ensembling. The framework offers several advantages, including adaptability to any number of classes and logical constraints, an innovative method for managing class imbalance, the elimination of confidence threshold selection, and a modular structure. Two experiments were conducted to compare the performance of conventional classification models with the multiplex approach. Our results demonstrate that the multiplex approach can improve classification performance significantly (up to 10% gain in overall F1 score), particularly in classification problems with a large number of classes and pronounced class imbalances. However, it also has limitations, as it requires a thorough understanding of the problem domain and some experience with ontology engineering, and it involves training multiple models, which can make the whole process more intricate. Overall, this methodology provides a valuable tool for researchers and practitioners dealing with complex classification problems in machine learning.",

The proposed solution enhances the LLM-powered role-playing simulation with RAG ‘feeding’ the LLM with three different types of external knowledge. This knowledge corresponds to the knowledge required by each of the COE roles (agents), using a component-based framework, as follows: (a) domain-specific data-centric documents, (b) OWL documentation, and (c) ReAct guidelines. The aforementioned components are evaluated in combination, with the aim of investigating their impact on the quality of generated ontologies. The aim of this work is twofold, (a) to identify the capacity of LLM-based agents to generate acceptable (by human-experts) ontologies through agentic collaborative ontology engineering (ACOE) role-playing simulation, at specific levels of acceptance (accuracy, validity, and expressiveness of ontologies) without human intervention and (b) to investigate whether and/or to what extent the selected RAG components affect the quality of the generated ontologies. The evaluation of this novel approach is performed using ChatGPT-o in the domain of search and rescue (SAR) missions. To assess the generated ontologies, quantitative and qualitative measures are employed, focusing on coverage, expressiveness, structure, and human involvement.",
